# Current Task

## Current Objectives
- Enhance the Dashboard component functionality
- Reference to projectRoadmap.md: "Create a dashboard for managing logged activities, rink visits, and progress tracking"

## Context
The Dashboard component currently provides users with the ability to log activities, view their activity history, and manage their profile. The component already has several key features implemented:

- User profile display with avatar and display name editing
- Activity logging with validation
- Activity history display with filtering and sorting
- Offline mode support with synchronization
- Edit and delete functionality for activities

However, based on the updated project roadmap, there are several enhancements needed to fully implement the dashboard according to the project goals.

## Next Steps
1. Implement gamification features in the dashboard:
   - Add badges and achievements for milestones
   - Display user's ranking on leaderboards
   - Show statistics for unique rinks visited

2. Enhance activity verification:
   - Improve the visual distinction between verified and non-verified activities
   - Add ability to verify activities when user is at a rink location

3. Improve rink integration:
   - Display favorite rinks section
   - Show recently visited rinks with quick access
   - Add ability to filter activities by rink

4. Enhance offline functionality:
   - Improve sync status indicators
   - Add conflict resolution for offline edits
   - Ensure seamless transition between online and offline modes

5. Implement data visualization:
   - Add charts or graphs for activity trends
   - Visualize rink visit frequency
   - Display activity breakdown by type

6. Optimize performance:
   - Implement pagination for large activity lists
   - Optimize data fetching and state management
   - Improve loading states and transitions

## Related Components
- NavBar.tsx (for navigation to the dashboard)
- MapPage.tsx (for integration with the map functionality)
- RinkDetailsPanel.tsx (for displaying rink information)
- Firebase services (for authentication and data storage)
- IndexedDB service (for offline data persistence)

## Technical Considerations
- Ensure proper data fetching and state management
- Implement error handling for network issues
- Optimize IndexedDB usage for better offline performance
- Consider implementing a caching strategy for frequently accessed data
- Ensure responsive design works well on all device sizes
- Add comprehensive testing for offline scenarios
