# Current Task

## Current Objectives
- Refactor the codebase to improve maintainability and reduce technical debt
- Reference to projectRoadmap.md: "Technical Debt Refactoring"
- Current focus: Refactor SearchBar.tsx component by extracting smaller, focused components

## Context
We are currently working on a technical debt refactoring initiative to improve code quality, maintainability, and performance without changing functionality. So far, we have:

1. Refactored `useUserLocation.ts` to use a state machine approach and extracted smaller, focused hooks
2. Refactored `placesAPI.ts` to improve modularity and error handling
3. Refactored `useRinkSearch.ts` to decompose it into smaller, focused hooks
4. Refactored `MapPage.tsx` to extract reusable hooks and components

The next component to refactor is `SearchBar.tsx`, which can be improved by extracting smaller, focused components.

## Next Steps
1. Analyze the current structure of SearchBar.tsx to identify areas for improvement:
   - Extract `SearchInput` component for the search input field
   - Extract `SearchResultsList` component for displaying search results
   - Extract `NoResultsMessage` component for showing no results message

2. Implement the extracted components:
   - Create reusable components with proper props and types
   - Ensure proper styling and layout
   - Add appropriate documentation

3. Update SearchBar.tsx to use the new components:
   - Simplify the component by using the extracted components
   - Ensure all functionality remains intact
   - Improve code organization and readability

4. Test the refactored components:
   - Verify that all functionality works as expected
   - Check for any regressions or issues
   - Ensure performance is maintained or improved

- src/components/map/components/LoadingScreen.tsx
- src/hooks/search/useRinkSearchState.ts
- src/hooks/search/useRinkSearchActions.ts
- src/hooks/search/useRinkSelection.ts

## Technical Considerations
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing components
- Ensure proper separation of concerns
- Follow React best practices for components
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Maintain or improve performance
- Ensure code is testable and maintainable
