# Current Task

## Current Objectives
- ✅ Complete Phase 2 of the Technical Debt Refactoring initiative
- ✅ Successfully merge the tech-debt-refactoring branch into main
- Reference to projectRoadmap.md: "Technical Debt Refactoring"
- Current focus: Address deferred tech debt items as outlined in mergeSummary.md

## Context
We have successfully completed Phase 1 of our technical debt refactoring initiative, which focused on fixing complex methods and components. We have:

1. Refactored `useUserLocation.ts` to use a state machine approach and extracted smaller, focused hooks
2. Refactored `placesAPI.ts` to improve modularity and error handling
3. Refactored `useRinkSearch.ts` to decompose it into smaller, focused hooks
4. Refactored `MapPage.tsx` to extract reusable hooks and components
5. Refactored `SearchBar.tsx` to extract smaller, focused components

In Phase 2, we have made significant progress:

1. Created core domain models:
   - ✅ Created `ActivityType.ts` enum to define the types of activities users can log
   - ✅ Created `Activity.ts` class with validation and factory methods
   - ✅ Created `UserRink.ts` class to represent a user's relationship with a rink
   - ✅ Created `RinkVisit.ts` class to represent a user's visit to a rink

2. Implemented the domain models:
   - ✅ Defined clear interfaces and types
   - ✅ Implemented validation logic
   - ✅ Added factory methods for creating instances
   - ✅ Ensured proper encapsulation of data

3. Implemented the repository pattern:
   - ✅ Created generic `Repository<T, ID>` interface
   - ✅ Created specific repository interfaces for each domain model
   - ✅ Implemented Firestore repositories for each domain model
   - ✅ Implemented data mappers for Firestore <-> Domain model conversion
   - ✅ Added offline support for activities

4. Improved code quality:
   - ✅ Eliminated code duplication by creating reusable helper methods
   - ✅ Enhanced error handling with consistent patterns
   - ✅ Improved type safety with proper TypeScript usage
   - ✅ Removed unused code and imports
   - ✅ Added comprehensive documentation

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Integrate repositories with UI components:
   - ✅ Update Dashboard to use the ActivityRepository
   - ✅ Update useVisitedRinks hook to use the UserRinkRepository
   - ✅ Update RinkDetailsPanel to use the RinkVisitRepository
   - ✅ Ensure proper dependency injection

2. Implement additional repository features:
   - ✅ Add caching for frequently accessed data
   - ✅ Implement batch operations for better performance
   - ✅ Add pagination support for large datasets

3. ✅ Implement error handling and logging infrastructure:
   - ✅ Created centralized `ErrorHandler` service for consistent error handling
   - ✅ Implemented custom error classes for different error categories
   - ✅ Created comprehensive `LoggingService` with different log levels
   - ✅ Added React error boundaries for UI error handling
   - ✅ Updated `ErrorDisplay` component to use the new error handling system

4. ✅ Enhance user experience:
   - ✅ Implement rink selection feature in Dashboard
   - ✅ Create RinkSelectionModal component for searching and selecting rinks
   - ✅ Integrate with UserRinkRepository to track rink visits
   - ✅ Add validation for required fields in activity logging
   - ✅ Fix activity type display issue (Open Skate vs. Recreational Skating)
   - ✅ Fix activity type filtering issue in Dashboard by ensuring consistency between UI labels and stored values
   - ✅ Improve RinkSelectionModal with search button and better user feedback
   - ✅ Fix accessibility issues and Google Maps API error handling in RinkSelectionModal
   - ✅ Add retry button for Google Maps API loading failures
   - ✅ Move Google Maps API loading to app level with GoogleMapsContext
   - ✅ Improve UX with better error messages and loading indicators

5. Update documentation:
   - ✅ Update codebaseSummary.md with repository pattern details
   - ✅ Update refactoring-plan.md to track progress
   - ✅ Update currentTask.md as tasks are completed
   - Create additional technical documentation for new engineers

## Future Tech Debt (Deferred to Post-Merge)

1. Complete Repository Testing:
   - Verify that all repository functionality works as expected
   - Check for any regressions or performance issues
   - Add unit tests for repositories (particularly for FirestoreUserRinkRepository)
   - Fix the known discrepancies between FirestoreUserRinkRepository tests and implementation:
     - Method name mismatch: Repository uses `toObject()` but tests mock `toFirestore()`
     - Result handling in `findByUserId`: Tests expect 2 results but get 0
     - Error handling in `delete` method: Returns false instead of throwing an error

2. State Management Improvements:
   - Evaluate React Context vs Redux for state management
   - Create a dedicated state slice for rink-related data
   - Implement proper state normalization
   - Add selectors for derived state

3. Continue Code Quality Improvements:
   - Identify and refactor any remaining complex methods
   - Improve error handling in UI components using the new error handling system
   - Enhance logging with the new logging service

- src/services/firestore.ts
- src/components/dashboard/Dashboard.tsx
- src/context/AuthContext.tsx

## Technical Considerations
- Follow domain-driven design principles
- Ensure proper separation of concerns
- Implement validation and business rules in the domain models
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing components
- Ensure code is testable and maintainable
